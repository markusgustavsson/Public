# Overview
Collection of generic scripts I made to assist helpdesk and engineers with their daily tasks.

# Prerequisites
Most of these scrips rely on AnyBox (https://www.donaldmellenbruch.com/project/anybox/)  
I've included AnyBox module in this repo, so no need to install the AnyBox module.  
This requires the AnyBox folder to exist in the script root folder.

# AAD-ForceSync.ps1

# Set-TransportRuleBlockClientRuleForwarding.ps1
